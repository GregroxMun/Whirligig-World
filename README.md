WhirligigWorld Planetary System: Absurd Homeworld in an Alien Solar System

![https://i.imgur.com/xX4qSTM.png](https://i.imgur.com/xX4qSTM.png)

WhirligigWorld is a mod which moves the Kerbal Space Center to the equator of Mesbin, a rapidly spinning supermassive airless planet. The solar system is also completely rebuilt, turning it into the Kaywell/Gememma binary star system.

-----------IMPORTANT KNOWN ISSUE, READ FOR FIX--------------------

The root part of vessels sometimes like to explode. This can be caused by using the teleporter in the cheats menu, and sometimes by s.o.i transitions. No known cure, as it seems to be related simply due to the fact that the space center is so far away from the "sea level."

This can be treated by quicksaving and quickloading to "stabilize" the game any time you're in a safe, stable orbit. Quicksave/quickload as soon as you're in Mesbin space or Mesbin orbit. This gives you a quickload point AND stabilizes the game to make SOI changes less buggy. You should also quicksave before changing SOIs, and quicksave/quickload once you're in the new SOI. The bug also only seems to explode the root part of the vessel. If you make the root part a non-essential part instead of a command pod, you may be able to recover from an explosion.

This is the only bug that comes close to game breaking. That's why I am making such a big deal of it! It is treatable, and I hope that some day there may be a fix for it. Note that this only happens when Mesbin is the homeworld. The bug does not occur when you're playing with the Kerbmun homeworld patch enabled.

------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------IMPORTANT COMPATIBILITY NOTICE--------------------

Make sure, when updating the mod, you delete the old WhirligigWorld folder before you install the new one.
Also, make sure you are using the latest version of Kopernicus. (or latest backport if you're playing on old KSP)

BACKSTORY

Two centuries ago, explorers from the far off planet Kerbin left their home to colonize other star systems. Preliminary transit data suggested the third planet of Kaywell's star had an oxygen atmosphere and water. It did not.

Unable to correct their course due to piloting error, the U.S.C. Manifest Destiny crashed into the massive, 70 Kerbin Mass planet Mesbin. Luckily, Mesbin spins. Once every twenty eight minutes it spins, and the centripetal effect pushes the equator outwards and negates some of the gravity. The 13 gees of gravity at the poles is reduced to a tad over 1.2 gee at the equator.

The payload of the ship survived, but the engines and fuel tanks were reduced to a lot of metal rubble along the surface. Unable to find somewhere else to go, they buried themselves underground and set up a stable ecosystem and environment down there. Eventually the colony was sufficiently industrialized to start looking up again.

CAREER MODE NOTES:

* It is refreshing to play in this system if you're already used to career mode.
* Do try this in career mode--I've had a lot of fun with this!
* The tech tree has been reconfigured to make more sense: 
* Aviation node merged with Aerodynamics, and therefore those parts are later in the tree.
* The aerodynamics section is subject to change even more...
* Field Science Node is now where Aviation was before--rovers before planes!
* Science cost and node connections have been rearranged appropriately to fit.
* Changed Survivability from basic landing parts to probe cores. It's survivable because it's robots.
* Changed Stability icon from a winglet to the flight control icon, along with a few other icon changes.
* Landing node now contains the small parachute, the radial drogue chute, and the radial parachute, as well as all heat shields up to 2.5m.
* Unlock monopropellant and the linear RCS thruster in Stability.
* Both the radial decoupler and the 1.25m decoupler are unlocked in tier 2: Basic Rocketry and Engineering 101 respectively.
* Thermometer and Mystery Goo swap places.
* Barometer is unlocked earlier--and rebranded as AtMoCo surpluss cavern pressure sensors from a cave-city that lost all its air due to a tragic mistake.
* Added a scaled up Stayputnik clone called the Kaptunik, which is very heavy and lacks the internal antenna, BUT it does have full SAS autopilot (Prograde/Retrograde, Radial In/Out, Antinormal/Normal, Full Thrust/Cut Thrust, and Stage.) When you unlock the antenna you of course get all of that and manual control, but it's still really heavy. I may nerf it since I made the normal probe core appear earlier. * It will have its own model in the future.
* The small ISRU parts are unlocked earlier, so you can take advantage of mining asteroids earlier on.
* Pods and Lander Cans have been swapped around.
* Making History compatible, partially compatible with other mods.

------------------------------------------------------------------

SCIENCE NOTES:

All bodies have at least basic biome maps.
Most planets and moons have detailed science descriptions. The atmospheric analysis experiment will simply display the atmospheric composition used to generate the atmosphere curves.
Science has been balanced for career and science modes for all planets, but not fully tested. If you feel you get too much or too little science, let me know.

------------------------------------------------------------------

KAPUTNIK PROBE CORE:

The Kaputnik Mk0 Electromechanical Program Executor and Four-Function Calculator! A start-level probe core designed by me and modeled by NovaSilisko that is 1.875m diameter (1.25m mounting points), very heavy, and contains all SAS levels. However, there's no transmitter/reciever, so the probe core can *only* use SAS for control until you unlock the antenna. Even when you do finally get the antenna and full control over the vehicle, and therefore have all the functionality of the top tier probe cores, you still have to lug that functionality around in a 1.2 ton mass of vacuum tubes, wires, metal gears and cogs.

------------------------------------------------------------------

OTHER KNOWN ISSUES:

* Kaywell and Gememma can be seen behind the equatorial bulge of Mesbin. This is inherent stock behavior--look for the sun lens flare behind a lump on Gilly or Bop.
* Part of the Space Center foundation is floating.
* Mesbin has an atmosphere that goes all the way up past the equatorial bulge. It is not functional, but is required for making engines work (Isp scaling) and for Career mode contracts.
* It is possible to fly through the terrain on Mesbin if you fly fast enough. This is related to its large size and the huge equatorial bulge. Less apparent in recent versions.
* Mesbin's shape is also not accurate to what the game insists is "down" as far as the camera works. So the middle latitudes will always appear to slope much more than their effective gravity would imply.
* The procedural craters don't match up between the color map and the height/normal map on Yawer.
* There are some issues with reparenting Kerbin using Kerbmun Homeworld swap. The orbit of the planet may appear to wander, and the Space Center scene will never be accurate. Kerbmun Space Program is also very much unfinished.

------------------------------------------------------------------

KERBMUN HOMEWORLD SWAP

There is a settings file that allows you to relocate the KSC to the surface of Kerbmun instead of Mesbin. It is unfinished, has incorrect science definitions and descriptions, and in general is only a backup option for if you REALLY want to play the system with a more conventional homeworld. Future updates will make the transition more seamless, but for now, consider this heavily work in progress.
To use it, follow these instructions:

1 Open the file GameData/WhirligigWorld/Settings.cfg in a text editor.

2 You will see a configuration node with "Homeworld = Mesbin"

3 Change "Mesbin" to "Kerbmun"

4 Remove the Career mode patches from WhirligigWorld/Career. (Tech tree changes, contract changes, and part changes.)

5 Restart KSP, and make sure to use a new save file or at least back up your old one.

6 Kerbmun is nearly identical to Kerbin, though slightly denser. Gameplay will be comparable to Alternis Kerbol or Laythe Space Program.

----------------------------

OTHER USEFUL MODS (that are neither supported nor broken by WW)

Cryogenic Engines. Energetic upper stages are good news for getting things out of Mesbin's deep gravity well.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/106089-145-cryogenic-engines-high-isp-chemical-rockets-august-7/

Kerbal Atomics. High efficiency and high thrust nuclear thermal rocket engines are kind of OP--except when you're trying to escape Mesbin's gravity well!
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130503-145-kerbal-atomics-fancy-nuclear-engines-august-7/

Eve Optimized Engines. Not useful for launching from Mesbin, but there are several destination planets with thick atmospheres that this may come in handy for.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/136342-14x-13x-eve-optimized-engines/

Transfer Window Planner. There is currently no delta-v chart (and probably won't be until I finalize the system design in 1.0). This mod is a lovely alternative, with plenty of information on transfer times and delta-v.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/84005-14x-transfer-window-planner-v1630-march-18/

Kerbal Engineer Redux. You should know what this does already! It's as useful here as ever. Displays information about crafts and celestial bodies. TWR displayed is relative to pol﻿ar gravity for Mesbin, which is about 10 times higher than the apparent equatorial gravity, so keep that in mind when building.
* Github Repository: https://github.com/jrbudda/KerbalEngineer/releases

RealPlume-Stock. Changes rocket engine exhaust to look different in a vacuum compared to in the atmosphere, by showing the broader expansion of exhaust gasses.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130576-14-realplume-stock-v120-30318-the-farewell-update/&

JX2 Antenna. Adds a huge antenna for sending probes to the outer system, in case you don't want to put out huge relays everywhere.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/153125-15x-jx2antenna-v205-giant-1000g-antenna-for-big-solar-systems/

Better Timewarp. Adds better timewarp controls including faster maximum timewarp, which is necessary when maneuvering around the outer system.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154935-15-bettertimewarpcontinued-customizable-time-warp-and-lossless-physics-warp/

SMURFF. Simple Module adjUstments for Real-ish Fuel-mass Fractions. It makes rocket parts lighter, so that stock parts can be used in Real Solar System instead of Realism Overhaul. However, it may be useful here given Mesbin's high escape velocity! Personally I don't use it, but it's something you may want to consider. I personally don't use it, but if you feel that WW is too hard with default mass ratios, you may want to give SMURFF a try!

Atomic Age/Spacetux Recycled Parts. Porkjet's original Nuclear Lightbulb and LANTR nuclear rockets are a nice, slightly more stockalike alternative to Kerbal Atomics, and the nuclear ramjet is handy for exploring some of the non-oxidized atmospheres of the planets in the system.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/164829-13-14-spacetux-industries-recycled-parts/

------------------------------------------------------------------

TO-DO:

* Complete Principia implementation, including axial tilts.
* IntakeAir/ResourceHarvester replacement so that atmospheres can have their oxygen partial pressure untied from the atmospheric pressure for jet engines.
* Vacuum Rocket Engine models.
* Custom terrain material settings for all bodies. (Or more likely, a few presets to use everywhere with one or two custom settings)
* I am also taking suggestions! Let me know what you think I should add. I probably won't be adding any new planets, but if there's some design feature you think I should change, let me know!
* Scatterer implementation.

Explanation for ellipsoid heightmap license:

Because someone stole my textures without permission but also because math is not art, I'm altering the license of the textures Ellipsoid.png, Prolate_Height.png, and the old deprecated texture Triaxial_Ellipsoid.png

The new license for these three textures is no longer the default All Rights Reserved copyright as with the rest of the mod, it is now Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). You can use these textures freely as long as you aren't making money off of them, you attribute them to me, and you distribute these textures under the same license (the rest of your mod can be whatever license you want and are allowed to use, only the ellipsoid textures need to be licensed with CC BY-NC-SA.)

Attribution should be by my username: Gregrox, or GregroxMun, and link to the WhirligigWorld forum thread or Spacedock page.

Obviously if you construct ellipsoid heightmaps on your own you won't have to deal with this license.

All of the above were being used without permission in Better Dres. They were also using Didd's ridge, which is not allowed. Didd's ridge is artwork, not math, and so it remains under ARR. I have been communicating with the developer, who didn't realize another developer had sourced the textures from my mod. I decided to let them use WW's ellipsoid maps, as long as they remove Didd's ridge heightmap and attribute me. And so, needing a formal way of legally attributing me, I've had to relicense these textures.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

I hope you enjoy playing in this absurd system! I have certainly enjoyed making it.

I encourage you to post your mission reports on the mission reports forums and/or the KSP subreddit. For real time discussion, go to the #gregroxmun_mods channel on the Kopernicus Discord https://discord.me/kopernicus where you can find prerelease builds and development updates. I'd love to see someone do a youtube or twitch career mode series with this mod. If you make a video of this mod or see a video of this mod, let me know!
