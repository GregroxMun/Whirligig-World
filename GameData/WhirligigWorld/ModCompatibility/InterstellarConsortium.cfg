		{
			%displayName = Kaywell A^N
			%description = One of the brighter stars in the night sky, Kaywell's Star was named for astronomer Kaywell Kerman, who was the first to determine the star's distance and proper motion, using it as evidence for a much larger universe than had previously been expected, as some astronomers continued to believe that the entire Kerbol system was simply placed in the center of some sky-box just beyond the farthest planet. It is now known to be a multiple-star system with several planets.

	{
		@Properties
		{
			%displayName = Kaywell C^N
			%description = Kaywell was known to be a binary star since the time of Kaywell Kerman, but it wasn't until much more recently in the age of exoplanetary detection that Kaywell C was discovered. It's a small M1Ve-type red flare dwarf that orbits incredibly close to Kaywell A, and as such the two can not be split apart visually with even very powerful telescopes. Kaywell C was instead discovered using spectroscopy. Looking at the spectrum of light from Kaywell revealed that there were two peaks, one in the violet and one much dimmer peak in the near-infrared. This implied that there were two stars of different temperatures very close together. What's more, as the two stars orbited each other, the absorption lines in their spectra moved back and forth with respect to one another due to Doppler Shift, and thus the combined mass of the pair could be determined from the known period and new velocity.

			%displayName = Kaywell Ab^N
			%description = Kaywell Ab was the first planet to be discovered orbiting Kaywell, and among the first ever extrasolar planets to be discovered. Its large mass and radius combined with its short orbital period made it easily detectable by transit. It is thought to be a gas giant planet, though a very hot and large one.

			%description = The third planet to be discovered around Kaywell, and the second by transit, Mesbin is one of the densest massive planets known, and has two known moons discovered through transit timing and orbital "bunching", though it's possible that the larger is more of a binary companion. Despite atmospheric measurements being possible around both of the planet's moons, no atmosphere has yet been detected around this massive body, implying it may be a huge airless world.

		{
			%displayName = Kaywell Ad II^N
			%description = Kaywell Ad II is the second of two known moons of Kaywell Ad. It is smaller and closer to the parent planet. Since it transits Kaywell, it is possibly to determine the composition of the moon's atmosphere spectroscopically, and astronomers were shocked to discover a significant amount of oxygen in the planet's atmosphere. It is under continuous study, and a prime target for interstellar colonization.
