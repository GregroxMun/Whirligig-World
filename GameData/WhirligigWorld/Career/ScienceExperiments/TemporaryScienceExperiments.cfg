				default = Surveyed the sky for Deep Sky Objects. Detected a Planetary Nebula, which, by the way, and I'm breaking the fourth wall here, have nothing to do with planets. William Herschel, who discovered Uranus, named those nebulae Planetary Nebulae because their blue color and circular shape reminded him of Uranus.
