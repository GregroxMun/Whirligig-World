		{
			name = WW/Shol
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Taking care not to look anywhere near the Sun, you take a peek at Shol. It's not blindingly bright, but the brighter material of your space suit certainly is.
				InSpaceLow = Shol is an immense, dark, cloudy ball rolling beneath you.
				FlyingHigh = The scalding sun met with the scalding air does not bode well for you. You just hope you don't sink any lower.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Statmun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = It's really difficult to keep your feet on the ground. The moon is just rotating too fast!
				SrfLandedPolarMetal = You are having a difficult time figuring out which way is up and which way is down, between Mesbin in the sky, the curvature of the terrain, the slopes of crater walls and mountains, and the navigation instruments. This moon is just rotating too fast for its own good!
				SrfLandedPolarRust = You feel disoriented as gravity seems to point in the wrong directions. At least it's POSSIBLE to keep your feet on the ground here.

				SrfLandedVolcano = The mountain stands subtly above the local geology.

				SrfLandedMountains = The mountains rise high above the glacial plains, like icebergs in a great frozen ocean.
			}

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Jancy
			Values
