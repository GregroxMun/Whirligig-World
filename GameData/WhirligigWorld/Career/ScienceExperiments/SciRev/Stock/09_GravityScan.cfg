			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor maps out the delicately balanced gravity field of Mandrake and Rutherford.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lozon
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The sensor maps out the precise gravitational field shaped by the bumpy relief of this object. It seems to be, just barely, in hydrostatic equilibrium.
				InSpaceHigh = You're having a tough time getting the sensor to focus on Lozon, and not Mandrake and Rutherford.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Beagrid
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Between Mandrake, Rutherford, and Beagrid, the sensor is just getting confused.
				InSpaceLow = Sweeping out a density map for Beagrid. The world is largely homogenous, with some denser regions in the highlands and craters.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Jancy
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = After tweaking the sensor for way too long, you manage to get the sensor to recognize Jancy, and not Mandrake and Rutherford.
				InSpaceLowLowlands = Jancy's lowlands seem to be extraordinarily bumpy in the gravity map. There's some kind of complex structure beneath the surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tatian
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Mapped out the precise gravitational environment around Tatian, Mandrake, and Rutherford.
				InSpaceLowVeins = The cracks in the surface seem to have a higher density than the rest of the moon. Perhaps it is some sort of exposed crust, rather than cracks in the ice?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Pragnik
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The sensor maps out the internal structure of Pragnik. It seems like it could have a liquid ocean under its surface.
