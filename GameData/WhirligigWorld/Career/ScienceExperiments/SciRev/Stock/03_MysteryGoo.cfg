	{
		InSpace = The goo begins to swell, and the fluids at the surface of the goo seem to be boiling. The goo is developing a hardened skin to cope, but after a few moments of exposure, the goo seems to be dying of a lack of hydrogen to breathe.
		SrfLanded = The goo begins to swell, and the fluids at the surface of the goo seem to be boiling. The goo is developing a hardened skin to cope, but after a few moments of exposure, the goo seems to be dying of a lack of hydrogen to breathe.
		FlyingHigh = The goo sprays out of the container when exposed to the airstream.
		
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kaywell_A
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The goo pops and boils. The goo is developing a hardened skin to cope, but that skin seems to be reddening and developing welts. After a few moments of exposure, all signs of life seem to be gone.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Shol
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = Exposing the goo to Shol's upper atmosphere at this speed results in the goo splattering out of the container. What remains seems to be burning up.
				FlyingLow = The goo boils away, leaving a charred residue behind.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Wolda
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Wolda's surface is no friendlier than anywhere else with a vacuum. The goo is boiling and popping, and it seems to be writhing within the container.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tyepolbynar
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The goo splatters out of the container. The remains appear to be "burning," though the reaction is a reduction rather than oxidation.
				FlyingLow = The goo is quite comfortable here. If it weren't for the lack of oxygen, Tyepolbynar might be considered habitable.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Imterril
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The goo seems to have formed a protective coating to prevent it from boiling at these temperatures and pressures.
				FlyingLow = The goo writhes in its container, forming tendrils. After a short time, the goo ceases to move at all, and turns gray.
				SrfSplashed = The goo writhes in its container, forming tendrils which break out of the container and soak into the water. After a short time, the goo ceases to move at all, and turns gray.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kerbmun
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The goo seems to be freezing when hidden from the airstream.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Derbin
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo seems to be quite comfortable here. The metabolism has slowed down due to the reduced hydrogen, but it's able to take in enough to survive. The goo is weathering the warm temperatures quite well, as well.
				SrfLandedContinents = The goo seems to be quite comfortable here. The metabolism has slowed down due to the reduced hydrogen, but it's able to take in enough to survive. The goo is weathering the warm temperatures quite well, as well.
				SrfLandedHighlands = The goo seems to be quite comfortable here. The metabolism has slowed down due to the reduced hydrogen, but it's able to take in enough to survive. The goo seems to be producing some kind of waste gas to keep itself warm in the cooler temperatures of the mountains.
				SrfLanded = The goo seems to be quite comfortable here. The metabolism has slowed down due to the reduced hydrogen, but it's able to take in enough to survive.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Valyr
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo is breathing hydrogen normally, and fills the container as a spongy mass.
				SrfLanded = The goo is comfortable here. It is breathing hydrogen normally, its at a comfortable temperature, and it seems to have altered its color to become green--perhaps some kind of photosynthetic pigment?
				SrfSplashed = The goo escapes out into the water! What little is left seems to be reproducing and growing! This is a planetary protection emergency!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Denna
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo seems to be fizzling oddly here. The usual vacuum reaction seems to take place after a few moments, but the goo has changed to a greenish color as it dies.

			name = WW/Plaph
			Values
			{

		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Oshan
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo begins to freeze. After the outer layers freeze over into a hemispherical blue-white coat, the interior seems to heat up somewhat. Some gasses are being emitted, due to some kind of heating instinct. After a while, the goo runs out of hydrogen and energy, and the entire structure freezes through.

			name = WW/Ammenon
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = The goo pops and boils. It attempts to escape out into the lava, but what drops escape the container only fizzle pointlessly on the surface. Curiously, though, a few minutes after, the lava begins to take on a reddish-violet hue.
