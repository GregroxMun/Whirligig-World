		Body
		{
			name = WW/Shol
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = Exposing the goo to Shol's upper atmosphere at this speed results in the goo splattering out of the container. What remains seems to be burning up.

		Body
		{

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tyepolbynar
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The goo splatters out of the container. The remains appear to be "burning," though the reaction is a reduction rather than oxidation.
				FlyingLow = The goo is quite comfortable here. If it weren't for the lack of oxygen, Tyepolbynar might be considered habitable.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Imterril
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The goo seems to have formed a protective coating to prevent it from boiling at these temperatures and pressures.
				FlyingLow = The goo writhes in its container, forming tendrils. After a short time, the goo ceases to move at all, and turns gray.
				SrfSplashed = The goo writhes in its container, forming tendrils which break out of the container and soak into the water. After a short time, the goo ceases to move at all, and turns gray.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kerbmun
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = The goo seems to be freezing when hidden from the airstream.
				FlyingLow = Droplets of goo spray out of the container! This is what is often known as a "planetary protection nightmare."
				SrfLanded = The goo seems to be undergoing a complex chemical reaction with the atmosphere, producing water, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. It seems to be a result of the oxygen in the atmosphere... the goo seems to have stabilized after a while, and seems to be producing only CO2 bubbles. It seems to have restructured itself to take in atmospheric oxygen!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Derbin
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo seems to be quite comfortable here. The metabolism has slowed down due to the reduced hydrogen, but it's able to take in enough to survive. The goo is weathering the warm temperatures quite well, as well.
				SrfLandedContinents = The goo seems to be quite comfortable here. The metabolism has slowed down due to the reduced hydrogen, but it's able to take in enough to survive. The goo is weathering the warm temperatures quite well, as well.
				SrfLandedHighlands = The goo seems to be quite comfortable here. The metabolism has slowed down due to the reduced hydrogen, but it's able to take in enough to survive. The goo seems to be producing some kind of waste gas to keep itself warm in the cooler temperatures of the mountains.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Derminmus
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedFlats = The goo bubbles out of its container and drops onto the the ground, where it seems to be sucking up the green material of the flats and incorporating it into some kind of hard shell. Gas is fizzling out of the shell, but the reaction seems to be ongoing. Very bizarre.
				SrfLanded = The goo bubbles out of its container and drops onto the ground, where it absorbs the dark surface and grows in volume before boiling away. Strange.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Valyr
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo is breathing hydrogen normally, and fills the container as a spongy mass.
				SrfLanded = The goo is comfortable here. It is breathing hydrogen normally, its at a comfortable temperature, and it seems to have altered its color to become green--perhaps some kind of photosynthetic pigment?
				SrfSplashed = The goo escapes out into the water! What little is left seems to be reproducing and growing! This is a planetary protection emergency!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Denna
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo seems to be fizzling oddly here. The usual vacuum reaction seems to take place after a few moments, but the goo has changed to a greenish color as it dies.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Plaph
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo's reaction here does not differ from the boiling fizzling reactions seen in other airless environments, although it seems to be getting cold enough for ice crystals to form within itself. After a few moments, the ice crystals are rearranged into a white shell! The thing is holding on for dear life--but that life is too short. The goo dies of respiratory failure after a time.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Oshan
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo begins to freeze. After the outer layers freeze over into a hemispherical blue-white coat, the interior seems to heat up somewhat. Some gasses are being emitted, due to some kind of heating instinct. After a while, the goo runs out of hydrogen and energy, and the entire structure freezes through.
			}

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Manonam
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedLand = When exposed to the hard vacuum, the goo begins to swell, and the fluids at the surface of the goo seem to be boiling. The goo is developing a hardened skin to cope, then exposes tendrils out of the container. When they touch the ground, dark material from Rik seems to be funneled up to the central puddle, until the tendril touching the surface begins to freeze solid. After a while, the goo dies due to lack of hydrogen, and it begins to boil and freeze.

		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Egad
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The goo seems to be writhing around in the container. As it intakes the local air it fizzles and produces white crystals. Then the goo begins to pop and spark continuously. As the reaction ends, so too does all life in the container.
				SrfLanded = The goo seems to be writhing around in the container. As it intakes the local air it fizzles and produces white crystals. Then the goo catches fire! All that remains in the end is charred organic matter and hydrogen chloride.

				SrfLanded = The goo escapes the container, before freezing to the ground.
				SrfLandedLowlands = The begins freezing. Once covered in a shell of ice, it escapes the container and falls out onto the ground, where the ice shell melts and the goo--and the icy surface--begin boiling. The surface refreezes and the goo is lost! We may have a severe planetary protection issue on our hands, now.

			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = The goo pops and boils. It attempts to escape out into the lava, but what drops escape the container only fizzle pointlessly on the surface. Curiously, though, a few minutes after, the lava begins to take on a reddish-violet hue.

After a while, some of the goo comes back up to the surface where it forms thin films on the surface of the water. It is green now, and the sensors are detecting CO2 being emitted from the matts.
