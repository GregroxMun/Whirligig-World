		{
			name = WW/Wolda
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Results seem to indicate an almost 100% total lack of any hydrogen-bearing compounds on the surface of 2 Wolda. 
			}
		}
		Body
		{

			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The neutron pulses probe hydrogen content to a depth of several meters. Though the surface seems to be slightly hydrogen-enriched here, there is much more hydrogen down to a depth of between several centimeters and beyond a meter. There is likely a large volume of ice here.
				SrfLandedNeck = The instrument detects an enormous volume of hydrogen below the craft, indicating significant water-ice composition, quite peculiar given the insolation.
			}

		Body
		{

			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = The air and the ocean do appear to be hydrogen rich. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why. The air seems to be interfering with the instrument to such an extent that molecular hydrogen must make up some significant component of Imterril's atmosphere.
