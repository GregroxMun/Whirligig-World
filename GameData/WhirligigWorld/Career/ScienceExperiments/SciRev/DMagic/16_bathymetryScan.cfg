		Body
		{
			name = WW/Imterril
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashedShallow = The ocean is composed of superheated water contaminated with some other volatiles in both liquid and gaseous form, as well as some more solid salts and metal impurities. The ocean seems to go down indefinitely.
				SrfSplashedDeep = As depth increases, the salt and metal impurities rise while the gaseous impurities are decreased.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kerbmun
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashedShallow = Kerbin's shallow tidal regions are teaming with microbial life, silt, and... hold on. Can you see... fish?
				SrfSplashedDeep = Kerbmun's oceans are teeming with life of all kinds, from microbial plankton to kelp plants to huge bug-like animals. You immediately begin drawing up plans to start a sea food restaurant on Kerbmun.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Valyr
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashedShallow = The ocean is extremely basic. No, not... not basic like shallow. I mean, yes this is shallow waters. It's the chemistry kind of basic, okay? Like the pH? Got it? Don't drink this stuff please. Despite the toxicity, the ocean is teeming with microorganisms.
				SrfSplashedDeep = Valyr's deep ocean is home to a quite complex ecosystem of microbiotics and even simple sponge-like animals.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Oshan
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIcelands = This is not an ocean, per se. It's an oshan though! Hah! Haha!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yalthe
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashedShallow = The instrument has completely overheated.
				SrfSplashedDeep = It's remarkable we managed to get any data at all here. The lake is made of molten lava.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ammenon
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashedShallow = The surface of the sea is covered in floating pebbles. The composition of the sea is relatively low temperature molten rock. The temperature is still really high though, you wouldn't recommend going for a swim.
				SrfSplashedDeep = The molten rock and metal gets cooler and more viscous with depth. There seems to be some complex chemistry happening in the middle regions, however.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lowel
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashedShallow = The water is filled with microparticles of plastic, and with microscopic organisms.
				SrfSplashedDeep = The water contains some microplastic, and microorganisms swim freely.
				SrfSplashedSeas = The sea contains an ecosystem of remarkable diversity! Sea food might be popular here.
				SrfSplashedCanalsShallow = The water is filled with chemicals similar to industrial pollutants and pesticide and has actual pieces of plastic floating on top of it.
				SrfSplashedCanalsDeep = The water is full of nasty chemicals which are not far off from pesticide, not to mention all the microplastic.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gannovar
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashedRiftWatersShallow = The ocean is frigid here. If it weren't so salty, it'd surely be frozen.
				SrfSplashedDeep = Going deeper, it first gets cooler, then begins to get warmer as geothermal heat pushes up massive convection cells. The ocean doesn't seem to come to an end...
				SrfSplashedEquatorialOceanShallow = There's some microscopic organisms living in the ocean here! Algae, plankton, bacteria, and more types of microscopic life that haven't even been discovered until now. The oceans are quite warm here.
				SrfSplashedOceanHotspotsShallow = The water here is green below the surface due to all the life swirling around here. It makes sense--although it does get quite toasty at close approach, this is the place where the sun gets brightest.
