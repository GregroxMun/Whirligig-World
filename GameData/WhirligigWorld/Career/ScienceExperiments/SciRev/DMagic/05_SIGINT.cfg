				InSpaceLow = As Mesbin turns beneath you, you pick out various radio signals from the colonies on and beneath the surface.
				InSpaceLow = You pick up a news broadcast about how Mesbin is actually spherical. From this vantage point you can of course see just how flat it is. No signs of intelligence detected.
				InSpaceLowNorthPolarBasin = There is a very strange repeating signal in the sensor's output. It's too noisy to read at this altitude, but from a lower orbit it may be possible to get a fix on it.
