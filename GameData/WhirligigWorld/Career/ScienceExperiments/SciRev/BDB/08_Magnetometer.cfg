		Body
		{
			name = WW/Shol
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Shol has an enormous magnetic field which stretches all the way to Tyepolbynar! Perhaps this is caused by a vast ocean of metallic hydrogen within Shol, or perhaps Shol is just made out of neodynium. 
			}

			}
		}
		Body
		{

		{
			name = WW/Tannor
			Values

			Values
			{

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kerbmun
			Values
			{

				InSpaceHigh = There seems to be several distinct belts of greater magnetic field strength.
				InSpaceLow = Kerbmun's magnetic field at this distance is significantly stronger than Mesbin's at this distance.
				SrfLanded = Kerbmun has a relatively strong magnetic field, pointing in the geographical North and South directions plus or minor a dozen degrees or so. Geomagnetic navigation is possible here. Like Mesbin, it seems that Kerbmun must have a hot spinning iron-nickel core.

				InSpaceLow = Valyr's magnetic field is not particularly strong compared to Mesbin's.
				SrfLanded = Valyr's magnetic field seems to be oriented strongly geographically North/South. It probably has a molten iron-nickel core, but not a very large one.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Egad
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The magnetic field of Egad is very weak, but it's enough that it may have recently had a molten interior.

			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Reander's powerful magnetic field is slightly distorted near Lito.
				InSpaceHigh = Reander, like the other giant planets, has a powerful magnetic field which stretches far beyond its sphere of influence. Yalthe, Yokane, and Totooa both contribute thin plasma belts from their volcanism and atmospheres, which produces minor distortions in the magnetic field.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lito
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = There's an extremely weak magnetic field generated by Lito, but by far the more powerful field is generated by Reander.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yalthe
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Strong interactions with Reander's magnetic field are detected as Yalthe's volcanic plumes are stripped of charged particles.
				InSpaceLow = Yalthe seems to generate no magnetic field of its own, its internal heat being generated by tidal forces rather than a molten rotating core.

			name = WW/Yokane
			Values

			}

			Values
			{
				InSpace = There's a weak induced magnetosphere here, generated from Reander's much greater magnetism.

				InSpaceHigh = The complex interactions between Gememma and Kaywell's magnetic field are too complex to be summed up in a simple paragraph; many a scientist will have papers to write about this data.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ammenon
			Values
			{
				InSpace = A weak induced magnetic field is produced by interactions between Ammenon's iron-nickel core, and Gememma's stellar wind. During Gemmma flares, the magnetic field becomes significantly more powerful, and the power lingers for some time after.
				
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lowel
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Lowel's magnetic field reaches several planetary radii away.
				InSpaceLow = Lowel's magnetic field is fairly strong, implying that is has quite a strong geodynamo for a body as small as it is.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ollym
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = A very weak magnetic field indicates that Ollym' core solidified long ago, allowing its atmosphere to be largely stripped away and blasting the surface with intense stellar radiation.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mandrake

			}
		}
		Body
		{
