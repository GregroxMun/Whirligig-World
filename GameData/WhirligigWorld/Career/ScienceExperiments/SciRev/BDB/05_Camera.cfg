	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kaywell
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = The film burns out as the camera is exposed to an enormous amount of light and heat.
				InSpaceHigh = You point the camera at the Sun. You regret this, as the camera is no longer functional.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Shol
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Only a short exposure is necessary to pick up the swirling details of Shol's clouds.
				Flying = The camera burns out when exposed to the heat of Shol's atmosphere.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Wolda
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You take a short exposure and observe the details of Wolda's cratered, elongated shape.
				SrfLanded = The gravelly, bouldered surface needs only a short exposure--any more and the sensor might burn out!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tyepolbynar
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You take a photograph of Tyepolbynar. Its jets and belts will make a great poster at the Space Center.
				InSpaceLow = The small scale swirls of Tyepolbynar's atmosphere are recorded.
				InSpaceLow = Is that your imagination, or is that a dolphin? What even is a dolphin?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Jifgif
			Values
			{
				InSpace = As the photograph comes in, it becomes clear--It's a Peanut!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Imterril
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The photograph of Imterril's cloud layers will be invaluable to studying the dynamics of slowly spinning atmospheres.
				FlyingLow = News flash: cameras don't like being exposed to harsh conditions.
				SrfSplashed = The camera is not suited to being submerged in nearly boiling water--the film has degraded and the sensors are shorted out.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tannor
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You have to fiddle with the exposure and aperture to get an image that isn't whited out entirely.
				SrfLanded = You have to make a choice: see the stars or see the surface. The surface is too bright to see both at once.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Etrograd
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You photograph the curvy ridges running across Etrograd's surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Aerious
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You take a photograph of the rubbly surface of Aerious. The film/sensor is getting a bit dusty.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Wers
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You try to find a good angle to get Wers and Vizea together.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Vizea
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You photograph the terrain. With an uneven shape like that, fitting a map together is certainly not going to be easy.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mesbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Perhaps we could lie and say this was actually taken on Graymun... But why would we want to do that?
				SrfLandedNorthPolarBasin = The camera's mechanism strains to operate in the gravity, but you manage to take a phenomenal picture of the sky. If only we had a color camera.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Statmun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You photograph the pock-marked surface of Statmun.
			}

		{
			name = WW/Thresomin
			Values
			{
				
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Graymun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This is remarkably similar to what you might expect for a picture on Mesbin's surface--a lot more craters though.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Troymin
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kerbmun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You photograph the ground, taking note of the small plant forms that seem to be growing here.
				SrfLanded = You photograph the sky, taking note of its blue color and puffs of clouds--very pretty!
				InSpace = You take photographs of Kerbmun, in an attempt to produce better maps of the surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Derbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface looks incredibly eerie in these photos! Barren, but with a fog glowing in the sky.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Derminmus
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You take a color photograph, revealing the green flats of Derminmus
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Valyr
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLowOcean = You take photographs in an attempt to get some decent maps of the planet. Unfortunately it seems to mostly just be oceans and clouds...
				InSpaceLowLand = You take photographs of the landmasses of Valyr. These will make interesting maps when put together.
				InSpaceHigh = You take a photograph of Valyr from a distance. You can make out landmasses between the white clouds.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Denna
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Plaph
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Oshan
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You take photographs of Oshan. Hopefully these can be assembled into nice maps!
				SrfLandedIcelands = You take a photograph of Oshan from the surface. The atmosphere appears as a thin haze near the horizon and the bright white surface threatens to blow out the image.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Manonam
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The developed film contains only an image of renowned newspaper editor and politician William Allen Kerman. Very strange indeed... Upon futher inspection, it seems to have been a hoax--we'll be investigating this act of sabotage on our spacecraft's instruments while we attempt to salvage what little bits of the surface seems to have made it through.
				InSpaceHigh = Getting the exposure right so that the ice caps are exposed right along with the dark surface is quite difficult. Perhaps better luck would be had with stacking photos.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Didd
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Focussing on the surface at this range requires a minor recalibration of the camera's focal length--it's so small and so close!
				InSpaceHigh = You take a picture of a small asteroid found in orbit of Didd! It's Diddmun!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Egad
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Three filtered color images have been put together into a color image, and the resulting green sky looks truly phenomenal--if a little eerie.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yeerbor
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Rik
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Reander
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The lovely swirls and spirals of cloud visible in Reander's atmosphere make a beautiful picture.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lito
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yalthe
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yokane
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Dakkonme
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Totooa
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mally
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yawer
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Fophie
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gememma
			Values
			{
				InSpace = It is not wise to photograph a star with a camera directly.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ammenon
			Values
			{
				IceCap = Taking a photo of the farside requires fairly long exposures to capture the light from Kaywell--but thank goodness it's possible at all!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lowel
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The photograph is a little blurry, with odd noise due to cosmic rays, but you can make out the broad structure of Lowel--it is a largely reddish planet with some dull green regions and some blue seas. There seems to be some odd straight lines that look almost like railroad tracks on a map, but surely they must be some kind of visual artifact in the photo.
				InSpaceLow = The photograph contains startlingly clear imagery of Lowel's terrain. It is fairly heavily cratered, and seems to have an enormous network of straight lines etched into the surface, like channels, or canals.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ollym
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Photos of Ollym will be put together to form maps--though with the high relief, that might be an odd looking map.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gannovar
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You photograph the planet Gannovar from space, observing the white ice caps and darker smooth seas. It seems that Gannovar's ice caps are formed by the average insolation over time--hotter regions have no ice.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gallant
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mandrake
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You try to get a pic with Mandrake and Rutherford together in the field of view.
				InSpace = The relatively subtle patterns of cloud banding in Mandrake's atmosphere are not the most stunning sight, but they do offer deep insight into the structure of the planet.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Rutherford
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The vast swirling patterns--likely a result of the slow rotation period and small radius of this world--are picked up by the camera. This photograph would make a good picture to hang up in the office.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lozon
			Values
			{
				
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Beagrid
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Jancy
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tatian
			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Pragnik
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Well that's a surprise. A world so far out, so cold, and yet... so active? All sorts of active terrain types are present here, and these photos will entertain planetary scientists for years to come!
			}
