	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Wolda
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The relative position of Shol seems to be strongly related to the rate of ions being intercepted by the collector--which, it should surprise no one to hear, is on average extraordinarily high at this distance from Kaywell.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Jifgif
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Solar wind particles seem to have been channeled through Tyepolbynar's immense magnetic field and onto Jifgif--the radiation flux is high, and ions smash through the detector semi-regularly.
			}
		}
		
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tannor
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Tannor intercepts a lot of solar wind, and that combined with photochemical interactions between the icy surface and the UV light of Kaywell, results in a lot of ionized particles flinging around.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Aerious
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Aerious is mostly outside of Tyepolbynar's magnetic field, and so is hit directly by Kaywell's wind.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Wers
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ion levels are approximately the same as those found on Mesbin's surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Vizea
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ion levels are approximately the same as those found on Mesbin's surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mesbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ion levels are moderated by Mesbin's magnetic field to some extent, but for the most part the solar wind hits Mesbin at full force.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Statmun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ion levels are approximately the same as those found on Mesbin's surface.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Derminmus
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ion levels are approximately the same as those found on Mesbin's surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Denna
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Denna seems to be protected by Valyr's magnetic field, and recieves a low ion flux.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Plaph
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Plaph seems to be right inside of one of Valyr's radiation belts, and receives slightly more ion flux than Mesbin.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Manonam
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This far out from Kaywell, there's significantly less solar wind.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Didd
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This far out from Kaywell, there's significantly less solar wind.

				SrfLanded = This far out from Kaywell, there's significantly less solar wind.

		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Rik
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This far out from Kaywell, there's significantly less solar wind.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yalthe
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ionized particles from the plumes of Yalthe's volcanoes have been interfering with measurements, but it's safe to say an enormous amount of charged particles are entering the detector due to the influence of Reander's magnetic field.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yokane
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ionized particles from the plumes of Yokane's volcanoes have been interfering with measurements, but it's safe to say an enormous amount of charged particles are entering the detector due to the influence of Reander's magnetic field.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Dakkonme
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = A fairly huge amount of charged particles are entering the detector due to the influence of Reander's magnetic field. The phase angle of Lito seems to change the ion flux over time.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mally
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = A fairly huge amount of charged particles are entering the detector due to the influence of Reander's magnetic field. The phase angle of Lito seems to change the ion flux over time.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yawer
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = This far out of Reander's magnetic field, there's a very tiny ion flux.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Fophie
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Observations of Fophie's ion trail over time have been recorded. Unsurprisingly, the ion trail tends to point away from Kaywell!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ammenon
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIceCap = Detecting only a tiny amount of ionized particles coming from Kaywell.
				SrfLanded = An enormous flux of charged particles hits the detector, and sometimes Gememma flares out, and the detector maxes out during those events. It's safe to say that Gememma's flares are pretty scary.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gallant
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ion flux is fairly low most of the time, except during Gememma flares, which cause much more charged particles than you would find at Mesbin to hit the detector.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lozon
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The complex magnetic field of Mandrake and Rutherford produces strange ion flux patterns. Lozon intercepts more charged particles per unit area than Mesbin, but only when Mandrake and Rutherford are aligned.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Beagrid
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The complex magnetic field of Mandrake and Rutherford produces strange ion flux patterns. Beagrid intercepts more charged particles per unit area than Mesbin, but only when Mandrake and Rutherford are aligned.

			{
				SrfLanded = The complex magnetic field of Mandrake and Rutherford produces strange ion flux patterns. Lozon intercepts more charged particles per unit area than Mesbin, but only when Mandrake and Rutherford are aligned.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Pragnik
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ion flux is tiny most of the time, except during Gememma flares, which cause almost as much charged particles as you would find at Mesbin to hit the detector.
