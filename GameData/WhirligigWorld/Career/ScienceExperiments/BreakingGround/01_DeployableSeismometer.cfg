		}
		Body
		{

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Didd
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You're pretty sure if the impact had been any harder, Didd would've fallen apart.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Egad
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The impact has allowed the sensor to be more precisely calibrated. Egad's interior holds a decently sized iron core and an irregularity in the mantle.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yeerbor
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The seismic waves have revealed lava tubes near the surface! In addition, Yeerbor seems to be internally differentiated, and has a dense core.

		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Rik

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lito
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The impact has allowed for some precise interior modelling to be done. Curiously, the moon seems to simply smoothly get denser towards the center, and does not seem to have a core. 
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yalthe
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Calibrated Seismology data with well-understood impact. Yalthe's interior seems to be a hot soupy mantle with a reasonably large iron core.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Totooa
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Internal modelling enabled by observing seismic waves from impacts has revealed the internal structure of Dakkon. It has an icy crust with a large internal ocean, though most of its volume is taken up by a rocky mantle. There is a small iron core. The large-scale brown structures at the surface seem to be moving like continental plates on top of the thin but denser icy crust.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mally
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Interior modelling enabled by seismology has determined that Mally's interior is fairly homogenous, with a dense spot towards the northern region.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yawer
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Interior modelling enabled by seismology has determined that Yawer's interior is differentiated, with a rocky mantle and iron core, though an icy mantle makes up a large percentage of the planet. The iron core is spherical, and the rocky mantle is ellipsoidal.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Fophie
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = There seems to be vast empty pockets within Fophie's interior. An irregular rocky lump seems to be at the center.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ammenon
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Interior modelling shows that the mantle of Ammenon is not homogenous, with dense and sparse regions. The core is evidently molten.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lowel
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Interior modelling shows that Lowel's mantle is fairly stagnant, and there is a thin layer of liquid outer iron core surrounding its inner iron core.

		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gannovar
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Most of Gannovar's volume seems to be ocean, transitioning into solid water mantle. There is a rocky core at the center.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ollym
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Interior modelling suggests that the vast volcanoes at Ollym's surface are in fact related to structures which travel deep into the mantle of Ollym.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lozon
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Interior modelling shows that Lozon is mostly solid ice with a rocky core.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Beagrid
			Values

				SrfLanded = Interior modelling shows that Beagrid is mostly solid ice with a thin sliver of ocean and a rocky core.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Jancy
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Interior modelling shows that Jancy is mostly solid ice with a rocky core. There's some density anomalies near the top of the icy mantle that could be interpreted as slushy regions.

			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Interior modelling shows that Lozon is mostly solid ice with a rocky core.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Pragnik
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The impact has caused seismic waves to permeate deep into Pragnik, allowing for a model of the dwarf planet's interior to be formed. Pragnik seems to have an internal ocean with a crust that is alternatingly very thick and very thin. Its rocky core shows signs of convection.
