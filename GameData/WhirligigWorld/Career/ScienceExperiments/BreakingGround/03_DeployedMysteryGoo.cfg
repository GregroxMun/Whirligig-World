			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIcelands = The goo forces itself out of the canister and seeps into the ground, disappearing through tiny boreholess. The goo then pumps itself back up, and this time seems to have tiny krill-like organisms embedded within it. The Planetary Protection department will be FURIOUS but the astrobiologists and gastronomers will certainly be interested.

				SrfLanded = The goo flows into tall columns and sticks to the top of its container.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gannovar
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo tries to escape the canister, but the Goo Escape Prevention Mechanism finally does its job and prevents the goo from escaping by electrical means.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ollym
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The goo in the forms a sphere that pops and bubbles, forming warts on its surface, and then it rotates so that the warts are aligned with the sphere's equator.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lozon
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedFace = The goo forms the shape of an alien head, smiling, wearing goggles. It then forms a body, huge in proportion to its head, and its arms are seen sculpting a spheroid into a shape that bears more than a passing resemblance to Mesbin. Okay fine, the Goo has a religion, but why did it tell us *now*?
