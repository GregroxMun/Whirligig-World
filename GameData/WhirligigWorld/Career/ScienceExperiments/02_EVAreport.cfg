			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Taking care not to look anywhere near the Sun, you take a peek at Shol. It's not blindingly bright, but the brighter material of your space suit certainly is.
				InSpaceLow = Shol is an immense, dark, cloudy ball rolling beneath you.
				FlyingHigh = The scalding sun met with the scalding air does not bode well for you. You just hope you don't sink any lower.

			Values
			{

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Aerious
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Aerious is very lumpy indeed!
				SrfLandedLumps = There's something about the scale of this world that really makes you feel small. Aerious isn't a large celestial body by any means, but it's just big enough that you can really see the depth of it and feel absoluite awe.
				SrfLandedFiller = There's plenty of pebbles here with which you decide to play catch with yourself. You start to throw a pebble into orbit, before realizing that it could be a potential navigational hazard.

				SrfLandedEquator = You search the sky for moons, stars, and planets. You feel incredibly tiny, whizzing around on a massive rock in an even more massive universe.
				SrfLandedGreatRift = The ground rumbles beneath you. You hope no one ever decides it's a good idea to live around here.
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = The surface rumbles beneath you. This volcano certainly isn't just for show!

				SrfLandedPolarMetal = You are having a difficult time figuring out which way is up and which way is down, between Mesbin in the sky, the curvature of the terrain, the slopes of crater walls and mountains, and the navigation instruments. This moon is just rotating too fast for its own good!
				SrfLandedPolarRust = You feel disoriented as gravity seems to point in the wrong directions. At least it's POSSIBLE to keep your feet on the ground here.

			}
		}
