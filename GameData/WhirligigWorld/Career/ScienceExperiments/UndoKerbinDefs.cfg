		!KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = The heat rising from the sand causes the desert to move and shimmer.
		!KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = This looks like a bad place to land.
		!KerbinFlyingLowTundra = You see patches of frozen grass. It looks like it's pretty cold out there.
		!KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = You look down and see a sheet of shining white ice. If you stare at it too long your eyes start to water.

		!KerbinFlyingLowWater = From this perspective you can see the underwater topography.
		!KerbinInSpaceLow = It seems we are very much in space right now. The sky seems to be mostly below us.

		!KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The desert dust appears to have contaminated all the samples. We did learn that deserts aren't a good place to bring expensive science equipment, though!
		!KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The water sample has frozen solid and the goopy samples appear to be extra goopy.
		!KerbinSrfLandedShores = The water spray has rusted one of the samples and some of the electronics ar&/F***13e5rse4t8st######
		!KerbinSrfLandedWater = Everything has gotten really wet. One of the samples caught fire! Whoa!
		!KerbinSrfLandedWater = Exposing the power source of the lab to water has proved to be rather... enlightening.
		!KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = You expose the samples to the badlands of Kerbin, but worry that it may have a bad influence on them.

		!KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = This is dirt and grass, and some small rocks. You suspect this isn't going to be much of a groundbreaking discovery.
		!KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Here the surface is mostly barren... snow, dirt and rocks. You're very confident that if you looked under the snow, you'd find more dirt and rocks.
		!KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Lots of sand and rocks here. You're thankful that you've been in a climate-controlled environment, because it sure looks hot out there. The sand is dry and loose and it looks like it's going to take some effort to clean your gear afterwards.
		!KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The ground here seems to be completely frozen. It was very hard to scoop up this sample.
		!KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = This isn't really solid ground, is it? You got a sample but feared to dig any deeper because of the startling cracking sounds the ice made. You try to not think back on how you landed here.
		!KerbinSrfLandedShores = You took a sample of the soil. It's very muddy and sandy. There might be a body of water nearby.
		!KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The grass here is definitely not as green as other places, but the knowledge that you've been at a place called the Badlands makes you feel cool.
		!KerbinSrfLandedWater = You scooped up a sample of the surface. It's a very humid sample.  You hope the equipment has been properly waterproofed.
		!KerbinSrfSplashedWater = You've taken a sample of the water. It appears to dramatically increase the surface humidity of anything it touches.

		!KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The surface is charred and coated with burnt rocket propellant. There are also trace amounts of a conspicuous green substance.
		!KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The surface appears to be very hard, like concrete. It might actually be concrete. This could be a very good surface to land at.
		!KerbinSrfLandedKSC = This substance is what makes the scientists yell at us when we go into the labs without cleaning our boots first.
