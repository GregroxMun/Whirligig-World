//There's some pretty hardcore spoilers here.






























//We put a lot of work into these things, please don't just go and ruin it for yourselves



































//You can find these things orbiting Lowel. Just go there in-game, I garuantee you'll have more fun this way.













































//Well that's it, time for spoilers.

		default = The Ball Sat is a sphere less than a meter across, with an orange band around it and four antenna attached, some of them bent. The sphere seems to have been the victim of more than a few micrometeoroid impacts. What secrets of ancient alien civilization might be found within this sphere? The purpose of the sphere doesn't seem to be evident in its form--perhaps the remnant of an alien game of football? We'll have to return this satellite to our homeworld, maybe someone there can take a crack at understanding this thing.
