//There's some pretty hardcore spoilers here.






























//We put a lot of work into these things, please don't just go and ruin it for yourselves



































//You can find these things orbiting Lowel. Just go there in-game, I garuantee you'll have more fun this way.













































//Well that's it, time for spoilers.

It is nonsense to your ear, but it's nonsense gibberish, and maybe a thorough enough examination of this data will result in some idea of what Lowellian communication was like. That is, assuming that's the data stored in the satellite...
