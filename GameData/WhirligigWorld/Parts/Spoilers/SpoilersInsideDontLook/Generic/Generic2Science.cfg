//There's some pretty hardcore spoilers here.






























//We put a lot of work into these things, please don't just go and ruin it for yourselves



































//You can find these things orbiting Lowel. Just go there in-game, I garuantee you'll have more fun this way.













































//Well that's it, time for spoilers.

		Default = You figure out, with some difficulty, how to connect the data cable to your recorder. There seems to be centuries of data stored here that seems to represent a change in magnetic field strength. It does not align with modern measurements of the field of Lowel. It seems that Lowel at one time had a stronger magnetic field than it does now. There seems to have been a period near the beginning of the satellite's records where Lowel's magnetic field was changing polarity. Fascinating.

There seems to be centuries of data stored here that seems to represent a change in magnetic field strength. It does not align with modern measurements of the field of Lowel. It seems that Lowel at one time had a stronger magnetic field than it does now.

		GannovarInSpace = You figure out, with some difficulty, how to connect the data cable to your recorder. There seems to be centuries of data stored here that seems to represent the magnetic field measurements over time. It seems that Gannovar's magnetic field has been more or less constant over both the lifetime of the spacecraft, and the time from last data measured to now.
		GememmaInSpace = You figure out, with some difficulty, how to connect the data cable to your recorder. There seems to be centuries of data stored here that seems to represent the magnetic field measurements over time. Gememma's magnetic field seems to have been especially unpredictable and rapidly changing in strength and polarity during the beginning of this satellite's observational period. Fascinating.
