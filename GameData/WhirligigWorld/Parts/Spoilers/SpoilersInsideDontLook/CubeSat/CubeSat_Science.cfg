//There's some pretty hardcore spoilers here.






























//We put a lot of work into these things, please don't just go and ruin it for yourselves



































//You can find these things orbiting Lowel. Just go there in-game, I garuantee you'll have more fun this way.













































//Well that's it, time for spoilers.

	{
		default = It seems to be some kind of observational satellite, boxy in shape and covered in sharp impact wounds, the solar panels partly shattered. There's white text on the side. As you examine the satellite, a sinking feeling pools in your heart. This is it. This is an actual piece of alien space hardware. What happened to its builders. What does that alien text even mean? You'll have to return this home to make any sense out of it.

	RESULTS
	{
		Default = You figure out, with some difficulty, how to connect the data cable to your recorder. The computer within stores a remarkable amount of data. Some of it seems to be raw photos at a high resolution, and there's more data that will be harder to interpret. The photos seem to be mostly of cloud formations, perhaps this was once a weather satellite.
