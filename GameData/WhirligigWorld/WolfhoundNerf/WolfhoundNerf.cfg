	@description = While Mesbin engineers could never find the secret ingredient (often referred to simply as "Specific Im-balance") that made the Kerbin-built Wolfhound an engine of exceptional thrust and specific impulse, they were able to produce a reasonably efficient upper stage rocket motor. Despite its bulk, it is a very lightweight engine. Woof! The large bell of this engine will leave your ears ringing!
