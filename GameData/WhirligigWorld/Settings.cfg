{
	Homeworld = Mesbin
	
	//pick either Mesbin or Kerbmun.
	//default is Mesbin.
	//I highly recommend playing with Mesbin, it's a really fun challenge to play in this wacky homeworld.
	//However, if you REALLY want a more down-to-earth gameplay, let's rewrite history so that the colonists DID land on Kerbmun with a certain degree of success.
	//Kerbmun Space Program's science definitions may not make sense as they are currently using the Mesbin definitions. For now.
	
	//---IF YOU'RE USING INTERSTELLAR CONSORTIUM AND WANT TO SWITCH TO KERBMUN---
	//You will also have to go in the IC settings add homePlanet = Kerbmun.
	//By default the homePlanet = Kerbin setting is commented out. If it isn't, change the existing homePlanet = setting to target Kerbmun.
	//And make sure you're using WW/Kaywell as the home star, both for Kerbmun and for Mesbin based space programs.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	MesbinExosphere = True
	//---------YOU MUST SET THIS TO TRUE TO START CAREER MODE ON MESBIN----------
	//or else you will not be able to complete the "First Spaceflight" contract.
	
	//Pick either True or False.
	//default is True.
	//When set to False, the atmosphere will be limited to the atmosphere over the North Polar Basin.
	//When set to True, the atmosphere will go up to about 1980 meters above Mesbin Space Center, or 970,000 meters above the datum/sealevel.
	//...However, almost all of it will be vacuum, hence "exosphere."
	//Once you've completed the "First Spaceflight" contract, you can set this to False before your next restart, or at any other time.
	//Just be sure to turn it back on when you start your next career mode!
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	RealisticAsteroids = True
	
	//Pick either True or False.
	//default is True.
	//When set to False, the densities of the new asteroid types will be divided by 100 to bring them more in line with stock asteroids,
	//and the sizes of asteroids will be reset to the stock scales
	//Does not apply to Diddmun.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	ScaledClouds = True
	
	//Pick either True or False
	//Default is True
	//When set to True, Derbin and Imterril will have clouds painted onto their scaledspace maps, disappearing within the atmosphere.
	//When set to False, the default blue ocean texture is used for Imterril and the default planet map is used for Derbin.
	//This option is automatically disabled if Environmental Visual Enhancements is installed.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	OblateGiants = False
	
	//Pick either True or False.
	//default is False.
	//When set to True, Tyepolbynar and Reander will be deformed and slightly oblate.
	//This setting is sort of incompatible with E.V.E. Cloud maps will still be spherical.
	//This setting is also completely incompatible with Scatterer.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	StarColors = Compromise
	
	//Pick either Colorful, ZSPACE, or Compromise.
	//default is Compromise.
	//When set to ZSPACE, the lighting for Kaywell and Gememma will match the pale colors used for those temperatures in ZSPACE.
	//ZSPACE is the working name of the game about galactic exploration and furniture rearrangement being developed by NovaSilisko.
	//When set to Colorful, it will use the physically based colors on the thermal spectrum, 
	// but since it's not white balanced, Gememma may look unpleasantly orange.
	//When set to Compromise, the color values are all halfway between ZSPACE and Colorful. I believe this is closest to how it would really look.
	
	//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	KronometerMode = MesbinKerbin
	
	//Pick MesbinClassic, MesbinKerbin, MesbinEarth, Mesbin28, or Kerbmun.
	//Default is MesbinKerbin.
	//Requires the Kronometer plugin to be installed to do anything.
	//This setting will determine which clock system is used.
	//MesbinClassic: 1 day is equivalent to 1 hour, with 40 40-second long moments making up each day. 1.063125 seconds per second.
	//MesbinKerbin: 1 Fortnight is split up into 6 hours, with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. 1.1025 seconds per second.
	//MesbinEarth: 50 days are split up into 24 hours, with 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute. 0.984375 seconds per second.
	//Mesbin28: Same as MesbinClassic, but with a 28 minute day and 60 second minutes. 1.0125 seconds per second.
	//Kerbmun: 1 day is equal to the Kerbmun day, split into 30 hours, with 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute. 1.0093714 seconds per second.
	
	//RSS-scale options are also available if you're playing at EXACTLY 10x Resize and Rescale using Sigma Dimensions
	//with the day length rescale set to SQRT[10] = 3.16227766. In this case, 1 Mesbin day will be about 5379.0343 seconds long.
	//Pick RSSMesbin, RSSMesbin-90, or RSSKerbmun.
	//RSSMesbin: 1 Fortnight is split up into 21 hours, with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. 0.996117463 seconds per second.
	//RSSMesbin-90: 1 day is split up into 90 minutes and 60 seconds per minute. Every 14 days is a fortnight. 0.99611746296 seconds per second.
	//RSSKerbmun: 1 day is equal to the Kerbmun day, split up into 96 hours, with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. 0.997472693 seconds per second.
