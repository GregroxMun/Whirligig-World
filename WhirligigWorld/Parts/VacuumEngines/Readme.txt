Readme: WhirligigWorld Vacuum Engines Patch by GregroxMun

To use the W.I.P. Vacuum Engines, change the filetype of VacuumEnginesStockClones.txt to ".cfg"

These engines are all clones of the original stock engines, so they have no visual changes at all. But they have been rebalanced as if they had larger engine bells and thus a better expansion ratio. They are a little heavier, but they have a better specific impulse and thrust compared to their atmospheric counterparts. Currently they are unlocked at the same part in the tech tree as the stock version, though I eventually intend to make the atmospheric engines unlocked after their corresponding vacuum engine.

The feature is disabled by default until I can get models for them--my first choice, NovaSilisko, who made the Kaputnik pod and many of the stock part models, is busy working on a new game which you should totally check out:

I may get someone else to do them if I can find someone willing to work as a volunteer or else extremely cheap--and it's well known (or at least, should be) that artists want to and in fact deserve to be paid for their work. If you know or are someone interested, let me know.

Here's the stats for the engines as calculated:
