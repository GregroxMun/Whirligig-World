{
	Homeworld = Mesbin
	
	//pick either Mesbin or Kerbmun.
	//default is Mesbin.
	//I highly recommend playing with Mesbin, it's a really fun challenge to play in this wacky homeworld.
	//However, if you REALLY want a more down-to-earth gameplay, let's rewrite history so that the colonists DID land on Kerbmun with a certain degree of success.
	//When set to Kerbmun, some of the science definitions may still refer to Mesbin as a homeworld, and you will revert to the stock tech tree.
	
	//---IF YOU'RE USING INTERSTELLAR CONSORTIUM AND WANT TO SWITCH TO KERBMUN---
	//You will also have to go in the IC settings add homePlanet = Kerbmun.
	//By default the homePlanet = Kerbin setting is commented out. If it isn't, change the existing homePlanet = setting to target Kerbmun.
	//And make sure you're using WW/Kaywell as the home star, both for Kerbmun and for Mesbin based space programs.

	MesbinExosphere = True
	//---------YOU MUST SET THIS TO TRUE TO START CAREER MODE ON MESBIN----------
	//or else you will not be able to complete the "First Spaceflight" contract.
	
	//Pick either True or False.
	//default is True.
	//When set to False, the atmosphere will be limited to the atmosphere over the North Polar Basin.
	//When set to True, the atmosphere will go up to about 1980 meters above Mesbin Space Center, or 970,000 meters above the datum/sealevel.
	//...However, almost all of it will be vacuum, hence "exosphere."
	//Once you've completed the "First Spaceflight" contract, you can set this to False before your next restart, or at any other time.
	//Just be sure to turn it back on when you start your next career mode!

	RealisticAsteroids = True
	
	//Pick either True or False.
	//default is True.
	//When set to False, the densities of the new asteroid types will be divided by 100 to bring them more in line with stock asteroids,
	//and the sizes of asteroids will be reset to the stock scales
	//Does not apply to Diddmun.

	KronometerMode = MesbinKerbin
	
	//Pick MesbinClassic, MesbinKerbin, MesbinEarth, Mesbin28, or Kerbmun.
	//Default is MesbinKerbin.
	//Requires the Kronometer plugin to be installed to do anything.
	//This setting will determine which clock system is used.
	//MesbinClassic: 1 day is equivalent to 1 hour, with 40 40-second long moments making up each day. 1.063125 seconds per second.
	//MesbinKerbin: 1 Fortnight is split up into 6 hours, with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. 1.1025 seconds per second.
	//MesbinEarth: 50 days are split up into 24 hours, with 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute. 0.984375 seconds per second.
	//Mesbin28: Same as MesbinClassic, but with a 28 minute day and 60 second minutes. 1.01250 seconds per second.
	//Kerbmun: 1 day is equal to the Kerbmun day, split into 30 hours, with 60 minutes per hour, 60 seconds per minute. 1.0093714 seconds per second.
