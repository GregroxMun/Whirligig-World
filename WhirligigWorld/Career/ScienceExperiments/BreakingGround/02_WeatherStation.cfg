		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mesbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The exosphere of Mesbin is so sparse that there is not much in the way of "weather." Well... and you suppose this is a bit of a stretch... the occasional rocks that rain from the sky could count as a form of weather.
				SrfLandedPolarBasin = There is a mild breeze of cold air.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kerbmun
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedOceans = There's a sharp breeze of humid warm air coming from the sea. Occasional gusts.
				SrfLandedOceans = The pressure and humidity readings suggest that a rain storm might start in a few hours.
				SrfLandedSnowyMountains = Kerbmun's mountains get a hefty amount of snow.
				SrfLandedDesertIslands = The air in this biome is very dry and hot.
				SrfLandedMountains = The air here is generally very dry and cool. The winds are strong here.
				SrfLanded = It's been fairly humid recently, but warm enough that the rain never stops.
				SrfLanded = It's been somewhat dry for a while now, but very windy.
				SrfLanded = It occasionally rains around here, whenever it gets humid enough.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = It's very dry here, and very windy. And very, very cold.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Derbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedDepths = The windspeed is generally not very high here, but the pressure is high enough to make breezes as strong as gusts anyway.
				SrfLandedMaria = It's very humid here.
				SrfLandedContinentalShelf = It rains fairly often here, but the rain evaporates before long.
				SrfLandedContinents = The air is hot and humid all the time. Gusts of wind threaten to blow over the wind station every once in a while, and clouds which look threateningly similar to storm clouds flow past every once in a while.
				SrfLandedHighlands = The air is dry here and the pressure is low. The windspeeds are very high up here, and occasional gusts certainly don't help.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Valyr
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIceCaps = It's very dry here, and very windy. And very, very, very, very cold.
				SrfLanded = Occasional rainstorms wash through. The water itself is fairly pure, unlike that which is expected to be found in the oceans.
				SrfLanded = The humidity here is fairly high right now.
				SrfLandedOcean = The humidity here is pretty high, and rainstorms are quite common.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Oshan
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIcelands = The cool breeze barely tilts the windmill in the low pressure.
				SrfLandedIcelands = Dew forms on the instruments during the day, before freezing overnight.
				SrfLandedLandlands = There's not much of any weather going on at this pressure. Wind speeds are generally pretty low.
				SrfLandedLandlands = Dust in the air seems to be picking up. Perhaps a dust storm is beginning soon.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Egad
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIceCaps = The frigid air has formed a layer of frost over some of the instruments, freezing them up.
				SrfLandedIceCaps = The ice caps are apparently replenished by fairly regular snow showers.
				SrfLanded = The wind patterns change over time but generally go west-to-east.
				SrfLanded = A thin frosting of snow has occurred overnight.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lito
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = There's very little wind here. The air is somewhat stagnant.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Totooa
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = There's very little wind here. The air is somewhat stagnant.
				SrfLanded = The organic gunk in the air seems to change in concentration over time.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lowel
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIceBeltLowlands = The equator seems to be the coldest part of the planet on average. During fall and spring, it gets above freezing and begins to melt, but during the rest of the year it is totally frozen.
				SrfLandedIceBeltHighlands = The equator seems to be the coldest part of the planet on average. During fall and spring, it gets above freezing and begins to melt, but during the rest of the year it is totally frozen.
				SrfLandedUtopiaSea = The sea stores a lot of heat during the cold seasons, and so only begins to freeze over just as spring is beginning. During the summer, it gets very hot and very humid in this area, which begins to cool the area down as increased cloud cover decreases the albedo.
				SrfLandedKorvasPlanitia = There's not much rain in these areas. It gets extremely cold during the long winter night, enough that frost begins to form on the instruments, and then in the summer it gets so hot that the instruments begin to overheat.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gannovar
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The solar day length of Gannovar is twice its orbital period, and each hemisphere gets its own time in the spotlight. At one perihelion, one hemisphere is boiled while the other is freezing at night. At the following aphelion, that night hemisphere experiences a cool day, before plummeting back down and experiencing a boiling hell of a day. This plays havok with the ice/ocean feedback. Much of the ice is transient, freezing and melting over the year. At the subsolar point, evaporation gets so high that huge clouds are formed. And then when it cools down the following night, cold icy rain comes pouring back down.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ollym
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The weather on a world with such a thin atmosphere is hard to measure at all. Pitiful attempts at breezes rock the windmill back and forth, and occasionally dust settles on the top of the instruments.
