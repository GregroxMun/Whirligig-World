	RESULT
	{
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kaywell
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You feel kind of small right now... You hope you know where you're going.
				InSpaceLow = This is far too hot for comfort or safety, and even a cursory glance will certainly blind you.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Shol
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Taking care not to look anywhere near the Sun, you take a peek at Shol. It's not blindingly bright, but the brighter material of your space suit certainly is.
				InSpaceLow = Shol is an immense, dark, cloudy ball rolling beneath you.
				FlyingHigh = The scalding sun met with the scalding air does not bode well for you. You just hope you don't sink any lower.
				FlyingLow = As you take your last breath in the world of the living, you consider the events which have lead to you finding yourself in this most precarious of situations.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Wolda
			Values
			{
				InSpace = It's just kind of... a long rock.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tyepolbynar
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = You should really be getting back in the spacecraft.
				FlyingLow = This is a most precarious situation, you had really rather get back in the spacecraft around now.
				InSpaceHigh = Tyepolbynar appears as a bright blue ball hanging in the void. It is not alone, as you can see its several satellites.
				InSpaceLow = Looking at the cloud decks below, you feel humbled by the immensity and depth of this world.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Jifgif
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The minor moon is a two-lobed shape, perhaps it had resulted from the collision of two minor moons some time in the past?
				SrfLanded = Tyepolbynar is huge in the sky.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Imterril
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = As the superheated water scalds you through the cooling of your space suit, you can't think of anything to report other than expletives.
				InSpaceHigh = A beautiful blue-white marble. It looks something like Kerbmun.
				InSpaceLow = The world below is covered in many layers of white clouds.
				FlyingLow = You had better get back into your spacecraft before your suit becomes a pressure cooker.
			}
		}
		Body
		{

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Aerious
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Aerious is very lumpy indeed!
				SrfLandedLumps = There's something about the scale of this world that really makes you feel small. Aerious isn't a large celestial body by any means, but it's just big enough that you can really see the depth of it and feel absoluite awe.
				SrfLandedFiller = There's plenty of pebbles here with which you decide to play catch with yourself. You start to throw a pebble into orbit, before realizing that it could be a potential navigational hazard.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mesbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedNorthPolarBasin = The gravity here is intolerable. Each step is agonizingly difficult, and if it weren't for all the drugs being pumped into your blood right now you'd collapse under the weight of your *legs.*
				SrfLandedNorthTemperate = Moving around in this gravity with a space suit on is tough. How do people live like this!
				SrfLandedEquator = You look up into the sky and focus on the stars. Such an amazing sight, you can really understand why the Kerbals left Kerbin to begin with.
				SrfLandedEquator = This is such a massive space, really. Stuck inside the caves and lava tubes inside of which Kerbalkind has built their various societies, the idea of having an entire empty sky is really, truly strange to you. It's strange then just how familiar and calming this sensation is.
				SrfLandedEquator = You search the sky for moons, stars, and planets. You feel incredibly tiny, whizzing around on a massive rock in an even more massive universe.
				SrfLandedSouthTemperate = Moving around in this gravity with a space suit on is tough. How do people live like this!
				SrfLandedSouthPole = The gravity here is intolerable. Each step is agonizingly difficult, and if it weren't for all the drugs being pumped into your blood right now you'd collapse under the weight of your *legs.*
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Statmun
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Statmun, or "Aetheris Mons." Up close it looks clearly distinct from any mountain on Mesbin, it's a celestial body in its own right!
				SrfLanded = It's really difficult to keep your feet on the ground. The moon is just rotating too fast!
			}
		}
		Body

			}
		}

				SrfLanded = The dust is getting everywhere!
				SrfLanded = You start to say something dramatic and poignant about the plight of Kerbal-kind in this grand universe, only to be cut off by random radio chatter that the situation is nominal.
			}
		}

		{
			name = WW/Troymin
			Values

				SrfLanded = You consider opening up your helmet and taking a breath, but you're unsure of the safety of such an experiment. You take in the blue sky visually instead, wondering if this is what it was like on Kerbin.
				SrfLandedOceans = As your feet sink into the sand, you take in the blue sky, wondering if this is what it was like on Kerbin. The glittery blue oceans, the brown earth, the blue sky. It's incredibly serene. Why did this experience have to hide away for so long?
				SrfSplashedDesertIslands = As you wade into the water, you realize there are small animals swimming around in the water! This is profound news for astrobiology and gastronomy alike!
				SrfSplashedPolarIslands = As you wade into the water, you realize there are small animals swimming around in the water! This is profound news for astrobiology and gastronomy alike!

				SrfSplashedOceans = Just like Dawton Kerman's Family Water Recreation Systems back home--except... there's little animals swimming around in the water!
				SrfSplashedIceCaps = The water here is very cold. You adjust the heating system on your space suit.
				SrfLandedSnowyMountains = You contemplate making a snow angel, or perhaps a snowman.
				SrfLandedMountains = The view from up here is quite the sight indeed!

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You look down at the strange world. An equatorial belt of ice, criss-crossed with straight canals, some of which are dried up. What happened to this planet?
				SrfLandedLand = You look around at the desolate surface. It all looks too... artificial.
				SrfSplashed = The water here is just fantastic. The low gravity means you can really splash around. You wonder if you could even run on water... probably not.
				SrfLandedUtopiaSea = There's a blue sea, there's green plants. In the most unlikely of situations, you may have found the next best thing to Kerbin.
