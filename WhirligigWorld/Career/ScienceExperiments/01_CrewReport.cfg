		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kaywell
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You start to check off the checkbox for "very hot" when a drop of sweat stains the box for you.
				InSpaceLow = Things are getting a little stuffy in here.
				InSpaceHigh = As you drift between the planets, you reflect on the nature of Kerbalkind and what they are doing in deep space.
				InSpaceHigh = You realize, with dread, that you have forgotten your toothbrush. It's a long time until you can find it again.
				InSpaceHigh = Travelling through deep space being the intensely boring subject it is, you record in your log that the situation is more or less nominal, and get back to your game of computer-aided 3D Multi-Chess with Mission Control and the other astronauts.
				InSpaceHigh = Travelling through deep space gives you a lot of time to sit around and think. You wonder what they're doing back home. Not your home. Kerbin.
				InSpaceHigh = You write down some visual observations of Kaywell--with protection of course--and sketch out the features you see.
			}
			
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Shol
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Shol is absolutely gigantic.

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = We're in the Tyepolbynar system!
				InSpaceLow = Tyepolbynar is such a lovely shade of pale blue.
				Flying = Going up is very preferable to going down right now.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Jifgif
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Found a peanut, found a peanut, found a peanut just now. Just now I found a peanut, found a peanut just now.
				InSpaceLow = You are involved in a long, drawn out argument with mission control over the pronounciation of this minor satellite.
				InSpaceHigh = The minor moon appears to be composed of two smaller satellites that have stuck together. Or possibly there's some more complex structural failure involved?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Imterril
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The moon is a lovely blue shade.
				FlyingHigh = It's getting a bit steamy in here.

				SrfSplashed = Things are getting a bit too hot in here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tannor
			Values

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mesbin
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The big gray oval of Mesbin, surrounded by the dots and circles of its moons, is quite the sight.
				InSpaceLow = Crew reporting in, from Space!
				InSpaceLow = The ground seems to crawl by compared to the speeding star field in the background.
				SrfLandedLaunchpad = We don't seem to be moving very fast right now.
				SrfLandedRunway = I don't think anyone ever actually knew why we built a runway. I mean, the old KSC had it.
				SrfLandedRunway = You wonder if they could build a rocket that gets to orbital velocity before leaving the runway.
				SrfLandedKSC = This is the Mesbin Space Probe Complex. We're home!
				FlyingHigh = Yep. There's Mesbin down there. We're still below stable orbital altitude.
				FlyingLow = Is that... a blue sky?
				SrfLanded = We seem to have landed on a gray, airless planet. How peculiar.
				SrfLandedNorthPolarBasin = It's a struggle to lift your arms here. You're crushed down into your seat.
				SrfLandedSouthPole = It's a struggle to lift your arms here. You're crushed down into your seat.

		{
			name = WW/Graymun
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
				InSpace = You survey the gray moon from space, looking for a decent landing site. The maria seem like the best bet.

		Body
		{

				InSpaceLowIceCaps = Looking down you see vast white plains covering Kerbmun's pole.
				SrfLanded = The gravity's comfortable here at least.
				SrfSplashed = The craft bobs up and down in the waves.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Derbin
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You look down at the bright cloudy mass below, taking note of the cloud structures and continents you observe.
				FlyingLow = The air pressure falls off sharply with altitude, flying here is quite the struggle.
				SrfLandedDepths = Cabin temperature is rising, the air conditioning is having a tough time keeping up.
				SrfLandedMaria = Cabin temperature is rising, the air conditioning is having a tough time keeping up.
				SrfLandedContinentalShelf = Internal conditions here are nominal. You feel a bit heavy, but perhaps that's just because you've been slacking off in low gravity for a while.
				SrfLandedContinents = Internal conditions here are nominal. You feel a bit heavy, but perhaps that's just because you've been slacking off in low gravity for a while.
				SrfLandedHighlands = Internal conditions here are nominal. You feel a bit heavy, but perhaps that's just because you've been slacking off in low gravity for a while. You notice that the indicator light for the heater has been flickering.

		{

			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You think you just saw another minor moon out of the window.
				InSpaceHigh = "Son, I am able," she said, "though you scare me." "Watch," said I "beloved," I said, "Watch me scare you though," Said she, "Able am I, son."
				InSpaceHigh = Egad, a base tone denotes a bad age.
				InSpaceLow = Dad palindrome Dad
				InSpaceLow = I Palindrome I.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lowel
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = You watch Lowel carefully. At first glance it seems fairly normal from this distance, until you notice a white belt along the equator.
				InSpaceHigh = There seems to be some criss-crossed patterns on the surface, like some kind of channels or canals.
				InSpaceLow = The canals which line the surface seem to be mostly straight, and there is a green material around them.
				FlyingHigh = The atmosphere begins pretty high up!

			Values
			{
				InSpace = Ollym is a fairly normal looking desert planet--or it would be, were it not for the huge roughly circular bulges covering its surface.
				InSpace = You look down at the surface, observing the dusty reddish surface and the vast mountains. The mountains seem to have caldera on them, could they be craters?
				InSpace = Those mountains must extend quite a long way out of the atmosphere.

		{
			name = WW/Mandrake
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You note down how confusing navigating in a binary system is.
				InSpace = You observe Mandrake, writing down features you observed in your log, and doodling details of... oh wait, that's Rutherford. Or was it? Bah!
				InSpace = The planet is lit almost as well by Kaywell as by Gememma!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Rutherford
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You note down how confusing navigating in a binary system is.
