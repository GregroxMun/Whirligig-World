	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Shol
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = Shol's atmosphere begins at quite a high altitude.
				FlyingLow = Gathered atmospheric pressure data while deep in Shol's atmosphere.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tyepolbynar
			Values
			{
				Flying = Gathered atmospheric pressure data while deep in Tyepolbynar's atmosphere.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Imterril
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = Imterril's atmosphere begins at a very high altitude! It must be extremely dense.
				SrfSplashed = The atmospheric pressure is 15 atmospheres, enough to keep the ocean from boiling.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Etrograd
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Quite surprisingly, there does seem to be a thin atmosphere here!
				FlyingHigh = Odd, the sensor seems to have a glitch. This moon's exosphere shouldn't be anywhere NEAR this dense.
				FlyingLow = Quite surprisingly, there does seem to be a thin atmosphere here!
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mesbin
			Values
			{
				FlyingLow = The barometer detects a rapidly increasing atmospheric pressure with decreasing altitude!
				SrfLanded = There is little more than the smallest trace gasses in Mesbin's pitiful excuse for an atmosphere. This barometer is not precise enough to detect the atmosphere--it is infered from higher precision observations taken previously.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Kerbmun
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The atmospheric pressure is very close to standard atmospheric pressure in many Mesbin cities, and fluctuates slightly due to weather patterns.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Derbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedDepths = The atmospheric pressure is approaching eight times the pressure of the standard atmosphere.
				SrfLandedMaria = The pressure here is climbing to around seven atmospheres or so.
				SrfLanded = The atmospheric pressure is a fair bit greater than the standard atmosphere!
				SrfLandedHighlands = The atmospheric pressure up here is lower than a standard atmosphere of pressure.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Valyr
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sensor changes in atmospheric pressure relating to changes in humidity and weather patterns.
				FlyingLow = The pressure is approching six atmospheres, while the actual atmospheric density remains fairly low.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Oshan
			Values
			{
				
				FlyingHigh = There is an atmosphere here, but it's not much.
				FlyingLow = The atmosphere is very thin here.
				SrfLanded = The atmosphere is very thin here, but thick enough to support surface water up to room temperature.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Egad
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The instrument begins to corrode, upsetting its delicate calibration. It's around 0.5-1 atmosphere of pressure, it's hard to tell.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Reander
			Values
			{
				Flying = The atmospheric pressure seems to climb unendingly.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lito
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The air pressure is low here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Totooa
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedHighlands = The atmospheric pressure here is fairly low.
				SrfLandedLowlands = The atmospheric pressure here is a little thin, but not too far off. The sensor registers changes in pressure due to weather patterns.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lowel
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Lowel's atmosphere is quite thick for its size, but still fairly sparse.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gannovar
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The atmosphere here is thicker than expected.
				SrfSplashed = The pressure is 1.74 bar, but it rises as Gememma gets closer.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ollym
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The atmosphere barely registers.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mandrake
			Values
			{
				Flying = The atmospheric pressure climbs fairly consistently with depth.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Rutherford
			Values
			{
				Flying = The atmospheric pressure climbs fairly consistently with depth.
			}
