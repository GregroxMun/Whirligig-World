		Body
		{

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Tyepolbynar
			Values
			{

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Mesbin
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedNorthPolarBasin = The sensor records the incredible, crushing gravity of Mesbin's poles, probing deep into the core of the planet--the core appears to be extremely dense, possibly degenerate, and constitutes much of Mesbin's mass.
				SrfLandedSouthPole = The sensor records the absolutely massive, incredible gravity at Mesbin's poles, and probes for caverns and lava tubes.
				SrfLandedNorthTemperate = The sensor records the high gravity environment and scans for mineral deposits.
				SrfLandedSouthTemperate = The sensor records the high gravity environment and scans for mineral deposits.
				SrfLanded = The sensor scans for caverns, lava tubes, and mineral deposits, and reports on the true gravity of Mesbin's equator.
				InSpaceLow = The sensor maps out Mesbin's internal structure. There is a very dense spherical core of electron-degenerate iron-like matter, an oblate iron outer core, and a huge oblate mantle of rock.
				InSpaceHigh = The sensor maps out the gravitational field warped by Mesbin's odd shape.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Statmun
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The sensor records the mass of Statmun. It is extremely dense and internally differentiated, but it is not dense enough to be outside of the roche limit. It must be a single monolithic chunk, or it would have fallen apart!
				InSpaceLow = The sensor maps out the precise gravitational field shaped by the nonspherical dimensions of this object.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lito
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Lito's mass is significantly less than expected for such a massive world! Interior scans suggest that the planet is almost entirely made of ice with only a tiny rocky core!
