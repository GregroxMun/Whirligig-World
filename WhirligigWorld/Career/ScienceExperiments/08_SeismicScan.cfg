		Body
		{
			name = WW/Oshan
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIcelands = The ice is shifting, producing icequakes which the sensor can detect.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Didd
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The idea of geological activity going on inside Didd is laughable. Nevetheless, the sensor did detec--hold on, I'm sorry--the sensor Didd detect a little rumble.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Egad
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The tectonic activity is really strong here, the rift valleys must be fairly recent.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yeerbor
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Despite being a minor moon, Yeerbor is plenty active, and seems to be slowly being torn apart by Egad.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Yokane
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Yokane is understandably very active. The sensors register quakes and erruptions every few seconds.

		{
			name = WW/Totooa
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The surface is constantly moving slightly and the sensor detects slight tectonic interactions.

			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Minor quakes are common here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lowel
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sensor registers a few minor quakes, but certainly not enough tectonic activity to account for the canals.
				SrfSplashed = The sensor records the waves and water flows.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gannovar
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Gannovar's glaciers are constantly in motion, being squeezed and crushed against each other, and fracturing. The ground is very unstable.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ollym
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The planet seems to be tectonically active. Minor quakes are common here, and occasional major jolts are recorded.

			name = WW/Lozon
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Minor quakes are common here.
